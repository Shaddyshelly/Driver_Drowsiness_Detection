# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection
### Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving. 
### The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a person’s eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.

## Functional Requirement
### Python:

## Working 
#### In this Python project, we will be using OpenCV for gathering the images from webcam and feed them into a Deep Learning model(Dlib) which will classify whether the person’s eyes are ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’. The approach, we will be using for this Python project is as follows-
<li> Step 1 – Take image as input from a camera. 
<li> Step 2 – Detect the face in the image and recognize the face.
<li> Step 3 – Detect the eyes from landmarks. 
<li> Step 4 – Check eyes to check whether the person is drowsy.
